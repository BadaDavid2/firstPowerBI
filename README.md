# AtliQ Report
AtliQ and Indian based company that deals with the supply of harware parts to companies. It has a lot of branches and it is getting harder and harder to monitor the Revenue and to find out if they are breaking even. 
We have been provided with a MySql database and all the necessary tools to help analyse the businesses data. [Resourses](https://codebasics.io/resources/sales-insights-data-analysis-project).

### Challenges Faced while Working on this project
+ Working with `Sql`: This project was the first time i was ever working with sql so it was a bit challenging setting up `MySql` on my machine. But after many tries I got it and was also able to connect it to PowerBI successfuly.
+ Cleaning the Data: I cleaned the data using power query and it was a bit challenging because the data has a lot of inconsistency especially in the currencies table because it was entered in two different currencies so I had to convert it all to one currecny (Indian Rupee).
+ DAX: I had to create many new measures to use in my report and it was a bit challenging to do because I didn't know `DAX` at all so I had to learn the basics.

### What did I learn while working on thos Project?
+ I learnt how to ask the right questions to know the best insights to provide in a report
+ How to connect a `MySql` server to PowerBI
